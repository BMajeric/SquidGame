Instructions:

- You have 3 lives throughout all three games combined
- For every death you lose 1 life
- Clear all three games without using up all 3 of your lives to win
- The controls will require you using your camera so it can track your face (game specific controls will be explained later on)

Game 1: Red Light Green Light
- Get to the finish line before the timer runs out to win
- Keep your eyes open for your character to move, close them to stop moving
- You can only move when the light is green (the girl is turned around and singing), if you move when the light is red (the girl is turned toward you and silent), you die

Game 2: Dalgona
- Carve out the given shape from the Dalgona cookie before the timer runs out to win
- Move your face (the tracker is placed on the tip of the nose) to move the carving cursor along the lines of the cookie
- If you stray away from the line with the cursor, you die

Game 3: The Glass Tile Game
- You are presented with two identical glass tiles, one made from real glass and one from reinforced glass
- Choose the tile you want to jump on by moving your head left or right and then tilt your head upwards to jump to the selected tile
- The tile you choose will be highlighted so you know which one is chosen at every moment
- If you jump on the tile made from real glass, you will fall through it, die and have to start over (the broken tiles will remain broken even after you start over and the placement of the tiles remains the same)
- If you jump on the reinforced glass tile however, you can keep going
- Jump past all the tiles to win the game
